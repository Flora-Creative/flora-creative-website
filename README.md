# flora website

This is the business for building the flora website.

It is Elm. Also webpack because it's fun.

## get started
- clone it
- `> npm run reinstall`  (takes a little while)

## build it
- `> npm run build`

Files generated from the build end up in `dist/`.

## develop
To get a neat live server
- `> npm start`
